    "You and your pen pal, Vishal, have been exchanging letters for some time now. Recently, he has become interested in cryptography and the two of you have started sending encoded messages within your letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will use your Python skills to decipher the messages you receive and to encode your own responses! Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles. Here is his most recent letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like \"hello\" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of \"hello\", I would encode my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left with respect to the alphabet. So \"h\" becomes \"e\", \"e\" becomes \"b\", \"l\" becomes \"i\", and \"o\" becomes \"l\". Then I have my encoded message, \"ebiil\"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it by shifting each letter 3 places to the right. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer encoded message that you have to decode yourself!\n",

    "#### Step 5: The Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work! While you were working on the brute force cracking of the cipher, Vishal sent over another letter. That guy is a letter machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Salutations! As you can see, technology has made brute forcing simple ciphers like the Caesar Cipher extremely easy, and us crypto-enthusiasts have had to get more creative and use more complicated ciphers. This next cipher I'm going to teach you is the Vigenère Cipher, invented by an Italian cryptologist named Giovan Battista Bellaso (cool name eh?) in the 16th century, but named after another cryptologist from the 16th century, Blaise de Vigenère.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher which was a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. What this means is that opposed to having a single shift that is applied to every letter, the Vigenère Cipher has a different shift for each individual letter. The value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword.\n",
    "           \n",
    "    Consider the message:\n",
    "           \n",
    "        barry is the spy\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we want to code this message, first we choose a keyword. For this example, we'll use the keyword\n",
    "           \n",
    "        dog\n",
    "               \n",
    "    Now we repeat the keyword over and over to generate a keyword phrase that is the same length as the message we want to code. So if we want to code the message \"barry is the spy\" our keyword phrase is \"dogdo gd ogd ogd\". Now we are ready to start coding our message. We shift each letter of our message by the place value of the corresponding letter in the keyword phrase, assuming that \"a\" has a place value of 0, \"b\" has a place value of 1, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "                  message:    b  a  r  r  y    i  s    t  h  e    s  p  y\n",

    "      \n",
    "    So we shift \"b\", which has an index of 1, by the index of \"d\", which is 3. This gives us an place value of 24, which is \"y\". Remember to loop back around when we reach either end of the alphabet! Then continue the trend: we shift \"a\" by the place value of \"o\", 14, and get \"m\", we shift \"r\" by the place value of \"g\", 15, and get \"l\", shift the next \"r\" by 4 places and get \"o\", and so forth. Once we complete all the shifts we end up with our coded message:\n",
